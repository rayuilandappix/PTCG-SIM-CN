# PTCG-SIM-CN
感谢[xiaoxiaolong](https://github.com/xxmichaellong)的工作,我们可以在他的[PTCG-sim](https://ptcgsim.online/)上游玩简体中文版PTCG的标准赛制（TU-CRE）
为了让中文玩家更好的游玩我尝试写了两个Tampermonkey脚本，分别是ptcg-sim界面中文化的脚本和将繁体中文版官网中的deck导出为ptcg-sim可接受的csv格式的脚本。大家一起来ptcg-sim上练习吧！

Thanks to [Xiaoxiaolong](https://github.com/xxmichaellong)'s work, now we can play simplified Chinese version standard format (like TU-CRE) on his [PTCG-sim](https://ptcgsim.online/)!
In order to allow Chinese players to better play this excellent simulator, I have attempted to write two Tampermonkey scripts, one to localize the ptcg-sim interface and the other to export decks from the traditional Chinese official website to csv. 
Let's practice together on ptcg-sim!

因为很多玩家遇到不知道如何构筑卡表导入ptcg-sim，现在asiaOfficialWebside_to_ptcg-sim同时支持导出新加坡官网构筑器生成的英文版卡表到ptcg-sim支持的csv格式，好好利用这个构筑器吧

By asiaOfficialWebside_to_ptcg-sim_EN.js.Now you can also use https://asia.pokemon-card.com/sg/deck-build/ to build your English deck, and output it to csv by "output PTCG-SIM csv" button.
